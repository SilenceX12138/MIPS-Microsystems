# Leopard

This is a compiler of `C0` language.

* This project is constructed with `CMake`, which means the execution requires a `Cmake` suite on your platform.

* `submit.ps1` will generate a `.zip` file containing `./include` and `./src`.

* `test.ps1` will compile `./bin/testfile.txt` and run in `Mars` simulator whose output is saved in `./bin/output.txt`.
