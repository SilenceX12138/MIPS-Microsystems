# MIPS Microsystems

* This project contains three core components of MIPS Microsystems.
  * CPU: a `five-stage` pipeline microprocessor that can support 70 instructions and handle basic exceptions and interrupts according to MIPS principles
  * OS: an operating system based on MIPS architecture with Linux kernel to support `virtual memory`, process `management` and `system call`
  * Compiler: a multi-pass compiler for `C0` programming language and MIPS assembly language
